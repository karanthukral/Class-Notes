## Week 1: What to Listen For in Film
- Musical accompaniment of Narrative Film
- _Example_: Appolo 13 (1995) Composer: James Horner
  - James Horner did music for Titanic, Avatar and so on. 2 Oscars. Died
    recently.
  - Based on real events, failed 3rd apollo mission
  - __Clip__: Early in the film. Right before the launch
    - Without music: 
      - Transition between seemed abrupt because it jumped between a scene of
        panic vs a very calm scene. 
      - Stressful in the shower -> slow and calm in the ready room
      - You can also see some anxiety in the faces of the austronauts. 
      - There was a range of interpretation
      - Music can help with interpretation of people watching (a way to get a
        their message across clearly)
      - Sometimes in thrillers, the makers leave the music out to give a
        feeling of uneasiness, also confusion regading how to intrepret the
        scene. Adds ambiguity

    - With music:
      - Music starts just as the wife starts to accept that she lost her ring.
        It sets up the transition. It starts of and sets of the acceptance and
        realization that her husband is leaving embodies her fear and then
        starts becomming patriotic when we reach the ready room.
      - The start of music also gives the vibe that something wrong might
        happen.
      - The transition didnt feel abrupt anymore and the music helps the
        transition.
      - The start of the music is also very important. Film is a choppy medium
        and one of the main tools they have to smooth over the jumping between
        scenes is music. You can notice the music that is present in a scene,
        it usually starts off in the scene before it to help with the
        transition.
      - The music a sense of patriotic, sense of sacrifice. The austronauts are
        going to do something important and so on.
      - Where is the music isn't? No music during the shower scene. Why?
        - Small, intimate scene. Music would risk over dramatizing.
        - What are things that are going to be more important without the
          music?
        - Leave "space" for what follows? After the scene, music continues for
          several minitues through the launch scene.
        - One of the issues with having end to end score is that the music
          starts to loose its imapact. That makes it very important to also
          realize, where the music is left out.
        - Shower -> most vulnerable
        - In order to make someone feel powerless and vulnerable you shoot from
          the downward angle.
        - Since the camera angle is on her eye level, we don't have power over
          her and instead only her fear has power over her.
      - Music fades in under the shower scene - smoothes transitions.
        - Sometimes you want a jarring transition, boom you are in space, boom
          you are in the next shot etc and usually the music comes post
          transition.
        - You can use music in order to smooth the transition.
      - Instruments:
        - Brass - military - heroism - sacrifice
          - Brass -> military because brass military bands is a very common
            occurance. This association goes back a lot of years.
          - Brass and percussion are often used to conevey the military idea
          - These astronauts were military and the brass and military plays
            into it.
        - Symphony is very popular because it has some many sounds avaible for
          the composer to compose their music
        - Over history the western world has started to relate instruments to a
          single or a group of idea like the brass instruments in this scene.
      - Style: Chorale - Protestant Hymn - faith - sacrfice
        - The form and style of music is also important along with the
          instrument. 
        - Chorale are like hymns
        - Usually heard this style in protestant churches
        - All of the voices and notes move together
        - The parts moving as a group - very organized - parallel to all the
          people working together to make this mission successful. No one
          stands out and they work together.
        - Protestant tradition is very strong in the US.
        - The astronauts stand up and make the form of the cross - gives the
          feeling that they are being sacrificed. 
      - Tempo: Slow - restrained - controlled - professional 
        - Calm and organized
        - Undermines the professionalism and calmness of the people. They know
          they are doing something dangerous but there is still the
          professionalism etc.

- What is a movie?
  - Narative - tells a story
  - "Suspension of Disbelief"
  - Film convention attempt to minimize anything that thretens "Suspension of
    Disbelief". Except for the use of music
  - You walk into a movie theater and you enter an agreement with the movie
    maker to accept that the movie you are going to see is real and this is
    called "Suspension of Disbelief"
  - You need to buy into the movie because without this there is no point in
    watching movies if you are not going to belief this. 
  - What can undermine the "Suspension of Disbelief"?
    - Actor starts talking to the camera like House of Cards.
    - Mess up the continuity
      - Example: blood stain moves between scenes
      - Film makers really try to avoid this
      - Microphone drops into the scene
  - Any inconsistenties can challenge your ability to believe it and breaks you
    sense of belief.
  - Music is an example of something that challenges the ability to believe
    because we don't have music in real life to help guide us but we are happy
    to watch it in movie.
  - Music that distracts too much from the movie can hurt the movie
  - There is always a trade-off

- The four functions:
  1. Music can create a more convincing atmosphere of time and place
    - historical, cultural, geographical - BUT based on western conventions
    - Example: The 4th Indiana Jones movie uses a rock and roll track played on
      the radio from the 1950s to convey that the movie is now based in the
      1950s and not the 30s like the original. Subtle but gets the time period
      across and this speeds up the transfer of this information.
  2. Music can underline or create psycological refinements.
    - the unspoken thoughts of a character or the unseen implications of a
      situation.
    - foreshadowing - example the original Star Wars (1977) - Luke argues with
      his aunt and uncle and he goes and sees the sunset and the theme starts
      to play and this is the theme that later gets associated with Obi Wan,
      Jedi and the force. We don't know the meaning yet. This foreshadows the
      end of Luke's old life because after this is when he realizes that R2D2
      has ran away.
  3. Music can provide a sense of continuity of film.
    - structure of music "smoothes over" the discontinuous, chaotic nature of
      film.
    - The camera used to be stationary in the era of silent movies. Cross
      cutting (changing camera angles) started later down and its initial use
      freaked out people.
  4. Music can provide the underpinning for the theatrical buildup of a scene
  and then round it off with the sense of finality.
    - films are like rides and they tend to play with pace in order to make it
      more interesting to watch and follow.
    - music can affect the "pacing" of the scene.

- Examples:
  - Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Composer: John Williams
    - Very nostalgic movies. Speilburg made it like the movies he loved to
      watch when he was growing up. The episode would end with a scene where
      the main actors death is immenent but comes out of it in the next
      episode.
    - __Scene__: Jones in Nepal with his old flame trying to find something.
      Nazis come and Jones and his love escape and then the next scene takes
      place in Cairo. How does the director complete the transition between
      these scenes and locations? He uses the map and an animation on it to
      show the travel.
      - Example of Function #1, #3 and #4.
      - Helps with the continuity (#3) because the difference between the Nepal
        scene and Cairo scene. The music starts just before the airplane and
        map shows up and stays throughout the travel scene and end when we see
        them in Cairo. We hear the love theme played on the violin (very common
        to use violins for love themes).
      - Helps with pacing (#4). Starts of intense and then love theme starts
        whihc is also intense but the music calms down when they reach Cairo.
        The ride has come back to the station and is ending. Now we will get
        the imporantant dialogues. The music helps us go from the action scene
        in Nepal to a calmer scene in Cairo.
      - Western composer simplifying a culture and sets up the time and
        place(#1). Major scale very prevalant in western music. The more a
        piece of music is based on the major scale the more familiar and
        reassuring it will sound to someone from the western culture even if
        you haven't heard the particular piece of music before. As we get to
        Cairo, John Williams changes the set of notes used, and it vaguely
        (very vagely) sounds like the kind of music you would hear in the
        middle east. The idea that this is a foreign music. Sets up the idea
        that we are somewhere else and generically somewhere in the middle
        east. The insturments also change, start with trumpet (solo trumpet
        cause Jones works alone), to violins (love themes) and then to the obo
        in Cairo as you would here istruments like this in the middle east.
  - Alien Resurrection (1997). Composer: John Frizzell
    - __Scene__: Set years after the first 3 films. The main actor dies at the
      end of movie 3. At the time of her death she had an alien inside her and
      they try to clone her in this movie but she turns out as part human and
      part alien. Starts of slow and then suddenly picks up speed and intensity
      and you hear that in the music and then it comes back to a slow stop
      again.
      - Functions #2, #3 and #4
      - Drives the pacing
      - Foreshadowing too.
      - Atonal - no nice major scale. Sounds really cold, agressive, no warmth,
        no familarity.
      - Effective use of leaving music out. They could have started the music
        sooner but the silence in the begining makes the scene way more
        uncomfortable and the start of the music starts just as the pacing
        picks up.
