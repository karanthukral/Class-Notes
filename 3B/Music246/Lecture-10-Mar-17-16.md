## 2001: A Space Odyssey

- The film score is often cited as one of the great examples of modernistic
  music
- A film that is still believed to be a great marriage of film and music
- Score compiled from classical music
- seen as new approach to the relationship between music and film. (Would this
  approach work in other more conventional films?)
- combination of tonal music (some of the most familiar music) from 19-th century (Johann Strauss II/Junior) and atonal music from the 20-th century (Gyorgy Ligeti)
- directed by __Stanley Kubrick__. Known as an auteur. Similar approach to films.
- Kubrick usually worked with compiled scores
- Movie hailed as a masterpiece.
- You have the human race and the alien race whose presence is just shown by the
  inanimate black monolith

### Scene 1: Earth to the Moon Sequence

- Waltz/Tonal music accompanies the humans
- Very clam, quiet, old fashioned music
- Adds a sense of naivety to the scene representing humans
- Strauss's music

### Scene 2: Moon, Intro to the Black Monolith
- Ligeti's music
- Dense, atonal music
- Every single note is written by the Ligeti. His pieces are fucking hard to play
- Remarkable density to the music. 
- Lot of structure in the piece
- Kubrick used a piece that uses wordless voices. The reason behind this was that the voice give a sense of intelligence, presence. That is why horror movies also use this kind of music. 
- Human voice does something to our brain and evokes emotions
- crazy amount of information, so fast so dense, far beyond our ability to decode it.
- The stark difference between styles shows humans as naive and the aliens so far beyond us that we can not decode them (their music) but they are trying to communicate with us.

- Not something that would work for all films generally.
- When the music was playing there was no dialogue. When people are talking their is no music and only sound affects. 
- When the music starts, no dialogues or sound effects. It works well but only for this movie cause the slow movie builds the giant idea slowly. 


- Compiling scores were expensive by this time. The composer could charge what ever the fuck they wanted. Film studios are trying to reduce costs by the 60s.
- MGM came to cooper during 2001 shooting and was told that he could not use compiled score cause expensive. They gave him Alexander North as the composer, big name.
- Kubrick fought the composer assignment. MGM said that they would pull the plug if he didn't accept the composer. So North came in with 2 weeks so he wrote music for 22 hours a day.
- The movie premiers and all they hear is Kubrick's compiled score (temp track). MGM got pissed but Kubrick destroyed North's tracks. The reviews said that the music was sick. This led to discussions with Ligeti and MGM paid him a shit ton of money

## Jerry Goldsmith (1929 - 2004)
- born in LA
- went coast - studied with Rosza at USC
- Studied writing film music in university
- came out of television
- Worked at CBS after school. Started with CBS radio but quickly made the jump to the new medium of the time, Television. Works in television in the 50s and 60s. Starts to move past television and into films.
- wonderful tonal composer

## Patton (1970)
- Scored by __Jerry Goldsmith__
- sparse score (less than 40 minutes) for a 3 hour film
- Same director as Planet of the Apes. They were friends and Goldsmith scored 7 of the dude's films
- Music focuses on the character of Patton
- Use of electronic processing on orchestral instruments
- before the 1960s, WWII films were very 2 dimensional - allies vs Nazis. Were also sort of racist since some of there were being made during the war itself.
- Patton - one of the famous WWII US generals. He is portrayed as a very
  complex guy in the movie. The movie also shows that he has a dark side.
- 3 musical themes for 3 aspects of Patton's character
  1. A military march: uplifting, character that most people thought of, modern military general
  2. A hymn: religious side of Patton who asked ministers traveling with his troop to write prayers. Fairly short
  3. The Call to War: Patton believed in reincarnation and he believed that he 
     had been reincarnated over and over again as a general in times of war.
     Goldsmith saw something that the oldies did not. He understood that the
     recording studio could be used as an instrument (change the sound of the
     instrument post recording). He ran them through an echo device.

### Scene 1: Patton is in North Africa, taken a time out battlefield nearby 
- Patton is on the battlefield and he talks about a war that happened 2000 years
  ago and he believes that he was there
- Interesting use of the Call to War theme

### Scene 2: Advance in Europe: Montage
- montage - blending of all three themes
- march theme accompanies Patton and advancing troops
- religious theme accompanies the commanding offers, interesting use. Pragmatic?
  Idea that Patton's success - he is the answer to their prayers.
- reincarnation theme where we see the list of German causalities.

- Electronic/post processing of the music.


## Alien (1979)
- use of electronic processing (of music)
- contrast of tonal (human) and atonal (alien) elements
- integration of music with sound effects
- Director: Ridely Scott
- Story: Small group of people with very different personalities. Isolate them in a creepy place. All these people are normal people and they start getting murdered by something. Scott follows the similar story, creepy place: shit spaceship, murderer: aliens etc
- Scott built the sets with low ceilings. Shot 6 inches lower than the standard. Could always see the people but also the ceiling -> claustrophobic
- Scary movie

### Scene 1: The Ship
- flute in low range - quiet/fragile - represents the humans in hostile environment. Kind of tonal. Borrows a page from Kubrick's book. 
- "You can kill somebody if you blow really hard" - Simon Wood
- contrast with electronica and atonal effects representing the alien environment.
- contract of tonal and atonal 

### Scene 2: The Air Shaft
- pulse in harp adds to sound effects in creating tension
- atonal melody build anticipation with ticking/beeping sound effects
- sound effect drop out - only music stabbing unexpectedly
- sound effects and music build to climax
- A couple of crew members are dead. Remaning crew memebers figured out that the
  Alien is using the airducts to move around. They blocked all the ducts and
  they are going to use their rudimentary flame throwers on on end of the ducts
  and push the alien to the airlock.
- Atonal music was loud
- Music plays with the viewer - its not used in a consistent manner so it keeps
  you on the edge of your seat


## Planet of the Apes (1968)
- social and political critique
- blend of orchestral instruments with elements such as animal horns and mixing
  bowls
- scored by __Jerry Goldsmith__
- remarkable sense of soul: tackling the really important questions of the time
  like racism.
- The apes are divided in society -> the fairest skin colour apes are at the top
  and the darker skins were lower in society. Commentry on racism. 
- clash between science and faith
- For the music: interesting problem, distant future with Alien civilization but
  the alien civilization is living in the middle ages
- need to balance the idea of alien and mysterious with the olden age.
- just one tonal piece of music
- modernism approach
- very atonal score, sense of alien, mystery etc
- the way the instruments are played give a sense of old tech
- very short notes, even the ones that can sustain notes.

### Scene 1: Opening Credits
- Very few notes are extended despite having instruments that can sustain notes -> Pointalism
- Modernist approach -> throw away the old and come up with new stuff
- makes the music sound more percussive
- Goldsmith could be accoused of a sterotypical approach: primitive culture more likely to use drums -> Over simplification


- Used unorthodox musical instruments 
- notes chosen are not random, they form patterns, becomes an underlying
  structure to the score

### Scene 2: The Crossing
- Pay attention to the notes underpinning the score
- 3 parts
  1. Uncertainty: abstract musical accompiniments, echo affect, metal sheets, no
     clear sturcture
  2. Discover a plant: now there is hope, hear the core musical idea, idea is
     unfolded in 3 notes 
     - 4 sets of 3 notes -> set of 12 notes. 2 slightly varied set of 12 notes
       are repeated.
     - begining of mordernist era, all the old rules for composing were thrown
       out. The 1st set of modernist composers had to come up with new rules.
  3. glimpse of another human like organism (watcher): Chasing the primitive
     humans. Doesn't give any sense of danger more annoyed. 
- "12 tone"
- Arnold Schoenberg (2nd Viennese School)
- 1923 - development of "tone rows"
- Treat all 12 notes with equal importance
- moving avay from major/minor tonality
- Idea based on the repeating the chromatic scale
- Basic rules:
  - When you write a melody, you have to use all of the 12 notes
  - You cannot use a note twice unless you have used all 12 notes once
- "12 tone" music is the most important development for the mordernist music
- 3rd time "12 tone" music is used in a film
- Nominated for Academy Awards and thus puts the modernist music in the
  limelight

#### Apes Appear
- There is a shift in tone of the music
- Finally a sense of danger
- The horns are used as the manifestation of shock and fear from the apes.


### Scene 3: End of the Film
- Back into the forbidden zone
- Seen evidence of an earlier human race who were more advanced than the apes
- The crossing theme re-appears when the hero and girl ride on the horse
- Suddenly the music drop - very compelling reason
- Initially you get a feeling that it might be a happy ending but then the music
  dies and you see the hero in the sand. He realizes that he is on earth and
  always has been and this is our future.
- No music over the credits - cause any sort of music tells you that you are
  watching a movie. There is no sense of ending and the lack of music embodies
  hoplessness
