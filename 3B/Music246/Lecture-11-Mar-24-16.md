# Into the 1970s
- Since the end of the 1940s, film music has been moving away from the
  conventions of Steiner and Korngold
- Increasing the influence of American composers
- Increasing importance of pop music and Jazz
- We are start seeing more and more sounds coming up
- European composers dominated in the 30s, more and more American born composers
  start to come up in the 40s
- Their training is similar to the European composers but the style begins to
  evolve
- Increasing importance of non-western musics and sounds (not in cultural
  accuracy, but in creation of new sounds)
- Evolution of instruments - percussion, electronic instruments etc
- Increasing importance of atonality - music as sonic texture

- conglomeration continues - smaller companies are bought up by larger companies
  - not like the studio system
  - not buying theater chains
  - buying movie making studios, music studios etc
- film cost increases: 1972-1977: 178%, 1977-1979: 200%
- 1970s: 160 films per year
- 1937: 538 films are produced
- Genre/formula films
- films being put out are fairly safe. The culture of sequels
  - Don't have to spend time building up characters when it comes to sequels.
  - Can focus more on action
  - Built up audience
  - Genre/formula films - films following a particular styles. You go into the
    movie theater basically knowing most of what happens. Slightly different
    plot.
- "old school" seen as irrelevant
  - music
  - orchestra's falling out of fashion during the 60s
- Pop Scores - **The Graduate** (1967), **Easy Rider** (1969), **The Last
  Picture Show** (1971), **American Graffiti** (1973)
  - Use pop music instead of original score to cut costs
  - also makes sense because of conglomeration - parent companies known both the
    studio and music company
  - Pop music can help get more audience - can be released as a single or
    re-released and played on the radio. It helps both the film company and
    music company
  - cheaper
  - promotion
- In the 60s, all the Nixon stuff, Kennedy's assassination destroyed the American's faith. The movies in
  the 70s became more and more dark - unpleasant vs more unpleasant.
- Where would you put huge orchestral scores in these dark films

# John Williams

- born in 1932 to musical parents
- trained as concert pianist at Julliard
  - planned to be a concert pianist
  - became interested in film music
- studied film music at UCLA
- orchestrator for Tiompkin
- Worked as a jazz pianist for a bit
- had some experience in pop music when he was young
- turn into film music came in when he started working as an orchestrator for
  Tiompkin
- Television (late 1950s)
- **Lost in Space**, **Land of the Giants**, **Gilligan's Island** - all TV
  shows
- Late 60s, film work
  - started doing some noteworthy films
  - became a regular contributors to screwball comedies
    - ex: It's a Mad ....... mad world
  - Towering Inferno
- Composed for the **The Poseidon Adventure**
- comedies and disaster films
- By the 70s he has won his first academy award
  - didn't write the music but he was a musical director for a film version of
    **The Fiddler on the Roof**.

## The Sugarland Express
- stars Goldie Hawn
- given to a young and inexperienced director - Steven Spielberg
- Williams was asked to do the film
- Williams in his 30s, Spielberg barely out of his teens. They became friends.
- The film didn't do great but it garnered praise for Spielberg and Williams
  enjoyed working with him.

## Jaws (1975)
- Spielberg reached out to Williams to write music for a movie based on a very
  popular book about a shark
- Marked the rise of Spielberg
- Score captured the imagination
- Moment when the general public started noticing the work of Williams
- new approach to film promotion and release
  - released in a new way
  - typically the release would happen very slowly - starts with a couple of
    theathers. Would move to other theaters only after stopping at the current
    ones. level releases - Huge, big, small, tiny and so on.
  - would bounce around for a few months and then vanish for a few years
  - Then it would debut on television - years after initial release
  - Jaws was the first wide release - released simultaneously on 400 screens -
    huge deal at the time
- made back its money in 13 days
- **Jaws** began a shift in the attitude towards orchestral music in film
  - Helped re established the orchestra as an important force in film music
- Jaws is **not** mono thematic but the music plays a similar role to what music
  played in Laura
  - music in Jaws is the shark - you barely see the shark in the first half,
    mostly glimpses but you hear the music whenever its around
- Williams came up with a very simple theme for Jaws

### Scene 1: 2 Dumb Guys Trying to catch Jaws
- You never see the shark
- The music tells us everything
  - how fast the shark is swimming, moving
  - how dangerous it is
  - and so on
- Great job of building up tension
- Sounds like that the guy is going to get eaten
- music is a stand in for the shark
  - brilliance of William's simple melody
  - simple melody but you can do so much with it
- which is the first note? which note does it stop on?
- theme is semitone like the theme from Psycho
- no sense of where the root (first note) is, no idea where to stop
- sharks are relentless, robotic etc. The music follows it, no emotional
  quality, very robotic
- the driving rythym give you a sense of movement forward
- cello used for the theme (most times)
  - played in the bass register, carries a sense of the size of the monster,
    lives in the bowls of the earth
  - putting it in string helps. Brass instruments would seem loose/messy.
  - Strings also take a second to vibrate but the bow on the strings works with
    the strings. Scraching sound. Also used in Psyco
- The theme can be varied a whole lot, slow when its far, faster and faster as
  it gets closer and as it gets ready to strike 
- **THE MUSIC IS THE SHARK FOR THE 1st HALF (2/3ish) OF THE FILM**
  - Had trouble getting the shark working for a bit. Adds to the film in the
    grand scheme though.

### Scene 2: Town is in Denial about the Shark
- Notice that the music tells us everything what the shark is doing
- Pay attention to the music and camera movement used on the reaction shot of the sheriff
  (when Jaws eats a child)
- Theme becomes a frenzy as the shark attacks
- The sound when the camera suddenly zooms into the sheriff -> sound very
  similar to Psycho

# Modernism to Postmodernism

## Modernism
- Focus on change, originality and progress
- preoccupation with the intellect
- emphasis on formal structure
- sharp division in value between "Artistic" and "Popular" culture
- make them challenging, like puzzles, complex etc
- rarely is it comforting sounding, rarely is it worm
- creating a new set of rules - example 12 tone
- doesn't give a shit about success, popularity
- artists more interested in experimenting

## Postmodernism
- Embraces all historical and popular arts without value judgment
- Anything is fair game. You can call on any style you like - history, popular
  world etc.
- Not everything needs to be new
- emphasis on emotional appeal
- less focus on change and originality

- The Jaws theme sounds similar to a piece of music from the early 20th
  century, **The Rite of Spring** by Stravinsky. A modernistic ballet piece
  - riot in the theater when the piece was first played
  - huge deal
  - considered to be the first modernistic music
  - huge influence for music in Jaws

# Williams cont
- One of the first and best post modernist musician. Takes elements from the
  golden age and the modernist era

## Jaws cont

### Scene 3: Beaches reopen but with security
- Underwater shot, fin shows, panic
- Everything we saw in the previous attacks except the Jaws theme. Only music
  playing is source music which brings more attention to the fact that the score
  is missing.
- Why?
- Cause two kids are playing a prank -> using a fin and swimming
- up until now every attack is accompanied by the theme
- to reinforce this, we are given a fake attack without music
- The shark is embodied by the music - no music no shark
- They are doing exactly what happened in Laura. They are setting you up.

- rest of the film takes place in the sea
- first 2/3rd of the film, it takes place on land. The shark comes in, attacks
  and gets out
- last 1/3rd of the film in the sea. Shark's world, its in charge
- Boat called "orca" - only animal that can kill the shark at sea 

### Scene 4: On the Boat and Jaws appears
- sheriff throwing meat in the water to bait jaws
- suddenly jaws appears but no music accompanies it
- this is what Williams was setting you up for the first 2/3rd of the film
- security blanket of the music accompanying the shark is gone
- lack of music made the scene scarier cause the audience by this point is
  accustomed to hearing the theme when the shark appears. This won't happen
  anymore. The shark does not announce itself anymore
- Up until now we have been hearing Williams the modernist
- Now we hear Williams the post modernist
- music catches all of the emotion as goes through each moment
- Williams give us a "fugue" - one person starts singing, next starts singing
  and so on and they start to over lap. Soft Kitty, Warm Kitty is a round.
  - Goes back to the Baroque period
  - long theme, we haven't heard this for a bit
  - energetic theme
  - little themes come and go to the larger theme
- we get some comedic cause the scientist wants to get a picture and is asking
  the sheriff (who can not swim) to go closer to the edge so he can get something in the foreground
  for scale. The theme following this is very kiddish.
- The theme then gets intense building to the sailor shoots the shark with the
  harpoon.
- You hear the harpoon actually hitting the shark - the music is held back in
  that moment
- the music slowly dies down in intensity as the scene wraps up.
- music drives the pacing.
- pirate music as they turn the boat around - haven't heard this since the 30s.
- the music dies as the shark dives underwater with the barrel - similar to the
  end of the battle scene in **Seahawks**

- Williams brings backs orchestras and the tonal sound

## Star Wars!!!!!! Finally :D (1977)
- Lucas wanted a score that sound old fashioned, sounded like Korngold
- Spielberg told him to talk to Williams
- Lucas wanted to go very old fashioned
  - techniques like the flying words in beginning
  - sliding when changing scenes - scenes swipes from one scene to another
- hard a hard time getting the movie made cause movie studios found it very old
  fashioned.
- once made he had a hard time selling it to theaters who thought that the
  theater would be empty for that week.
- Once released the movie became a huge deal. Why?
  - it captured the innocence. The message of the movie was that young people
    who stayed true to themselves can change the world. Nieve idea but very
    different from the ideas of movies of the time. It came in a time of cinisim
    in the country
  - fantasy film in a sci-fi world
  - classic story
- Williams becomes the best known film composer of all time with the success of
  Star Wars

### Music 1: Opening Credits
- **FANFARE** - haven't heard it in like 30 years
- Utterly tonal and long theme, just like Korngold
- Starts with brash, heroism. Second part we go to the strings. Then the first
  theme comes back. **OVERTURE**, **ABA** theme
  - B is not the love theme. Shit's complicated lol
  - strong theme, slow theme, back to the strong theme
  - the theme doesn't end but transitions from the opening credits to the first
    scene
- First Theme: Luke's Theme
- Second Theme: The Force
- Princess Leia's theme
  - the interval at the beginning is the Major 6
  - feminine theme
- Imperial March - baddies
  - Usually uses brass
  - think about the difference between the brass sound b/w this and Luke's theme
  - Williams has them play the brass very aggressively
  - Luke's theme is supposed to resonate with you unlike this one. You are
    supposed to be invested in Luke
- Obi Wan's death is accompanied by Leia's theme
  - gives us an idea that Lucas actually knew that Luke and Leia were supposed
    to related. Its a love theme - love of family? not confirmed but interesting
    argument

- Brings us back to the golden age. Is it entirely like Korngold?, is it
  entirely modernistic?

### Music 2: Dune Sea
- R2D2 wandering on Tatoine alone and its getting dark
- He is nervous
- pretty modernistic sound
- isn't entirely tonal
- Heavily inspired from a section from Stravinsky's **The Rite of Spring**
  - uncanny resemblance
  - on purpose

- Score is very operatic - like an opera w/o lyrics
- Thematic transformation
- Very tonal themes so they are recognizable despite the thematic
  transformations

### Scene 1: Buying robots
- this is the first time we see Luke and we hear his theme

### Scene 2: Sunset
- Force music
- End of Luke's old life
- Next day he has to go out search for R2D2 and that starts the dominoes fall
  which leads to the intro to force and so all
- foreshadowing
- at the end you hear the imperial theme very lightly - foreshadowing

## Style of Williams
- 19th century orchestral tradition
- but aware of the newer modernist/atonal techniques
- Little popular/jazz influence - no popular songs
- starts with a basic orchestra and then adds what is necessary
- use of themes - developed throughout the film

- Both star wars the film and the score album were huge successes
- 1980-1993: He is the conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra
  - The most popular in US and one of the most popular in the world
  - they played a lot of popular music
  - they would be on the tv a whole bunch
  - Williams played the classics like Mozart but he also played his own music
  - his film work is reworked into orchestral works
  - self-contained concert pieces
  - music takes a life outside the film world
