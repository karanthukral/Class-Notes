## Psycho (1960)

- tempo is fixed, pushes through some scenes
- nothing *but* semi tones
    + keyboard -> two keys side by side is a semi tone

### Scene 1: The Money

- short repetitive theme that fractures
- quiet but unsettled - Marion's discomfort with the theft
- grows slightly in intensity
- camera zooms into money repetitively
- music doesn't tell us what Marion is thinking about, just that she is thinking
- semi tones all the time - no warmth
- rhythm breaks from time to time, but the same rhythm
- before: her underwear was white
- after: she has decided to steal, now her underwear is black
- color coordination is deliberate
- as she is driving in the car, we hear her thoughts, her guilt, conversations
  she *thinks* she might be having with people

### Scene 2: Flight

- music enters as she makes her "escape"
- at first seems to play her fear at being caught
- but as she changes, music seems to play her fall to the "dark" side
- even through it seems to open up at a spot, all notes are side by side
- no *big jump*
- Marion goes to a car salesmen to change her car
- as she is driving away, we see a policeman approaching
- all this would have been a perfect musical accomplishment
- but Herrman doesn't give us music here
- we get music when she is driving off - again reflection of her consciousness

### Scene 3: Norman

- Marion is lost
- finds herself at a creepy model
- Nornam spying on Marion through a peep hole
- theme for Nornam: two semi tones, we get variations of it
- again no big emotion, cold, uses violins to emphasis the coldness
- *white tone*: deliberately avoid the subtle rotating of finger on violin
- positioning of the semi tones are varied largely
- film clearly taking an unexpected turn
- Nornam likes to stuff birds
    + Marion's last name: Crane
    + she is she from: Pheonix

### Scene 4: The Shower

- no music until attack
- no tonality - strings "shriek"
- who's theme as the murderer flees the scene?: Norman theme in a variation
- music tells you who the murderer is
- POV of Marion
- not having that music: makes you uncertain
- originally Hitchcock didn't want music in the shower scene
- but Herrman records it anyway, Hitch likes it!
- extreme example of dissonance
- no element of note, theme, pitch

- part company during the filming of Torn Curtain
- Herrman didn't like pop music, Hitch wanted to go pop
- they had a fallout
- bitter, he moves to Europe: Truffaut: **Fahrenheit 451** (1966)
- came back, picked up his career
- last movie is Taxi Driver (1975)

                  ******End of Herrman******

## Elmer Bernstein (1922 - 2004)

### The Magnificent Seven (1960)

- influence of Aaron Copland
- clear melodies - folk song influence
- strong rhythms - syncopation
- the sound of the American west/American Nationalism

### Scene 1: Opening Credits

- similar rhythms
- clearly influenced by Copland's music

#### Key Word: Versatility

- new generation of composers capable of working in a number of styles
- end of the Studio System leads to freelancing
    + Hollywood had the whole industry locked up
    + then depression happened, more pressing problems than Hollywood's monopoly
    + after that: World War II
    + and then: Communism
    + finally 1960's government get's to Hollywood
    + freelance picks up

#### 1960's

- turbulent period in American history:
    + civil rights
    + Vietnam
        * US is loosing this one
        * they didn't really know who the enemy was
        * soldiers coming home in body bags, nobody knew why
        * people started questioning the people in charge
        * they had never lost before
        * we see young people protesting the Vietnam war
    + generational gap
        * between parents and children
        * after WWII concerns of parents and children changed
        * multiple demographics emerging for the first time
        * all these stuff gets mixed up in 1960's

- Films in the 1960's:
    + early 60's as extension of 1950's
    + by mid 60's the Production Code is abandoned
    + assassination of Kennedy
    + Hollywood responds
    + films become more explicit in subjects, visuals and dialog
    + cultural revolution on the late 60's results in films with a strong sense
      of irony and cynicism
    + films get more violent
    + we see blood for the first time, graphic use of sexuality and language
    + films trying to become more realistic
    + first time people questioning authority
    + we see films that are much more interested in the cynical depiction of
      what's happening in reality

- Rise of the Independent Production:
    + cost escalate
    + while orchestral scores are still produced, cost factors lead to many
      smaller ensembles or popular music scores
        * because they are expensive
    + salaries of actors off the charts if they are a catch
    + film expenses sky rockets
    + cheaper to hire a pop band, band also becomes a way of promoting the film
    + Conglomeration: film company and record company cross promotion but both
      owned by same parent company
    + so money stays within the company, just exchanging music rights

- Changing of the guard - end of the careers of Steiner, Newman, Tiompkin
- rise of american composers such as Bernstein, Jerry Goldsmith, Henry Mancini
- Second Wave of European composers

## Ennio Morricone

- born 1928, Rome, Italy
- best known for association with Italian Director Sergio Leone and the
  "spaghetti wester"
    + films largely made for American market, but shot in Europe(Spain, looks
      like Western America)
    + they were shot relatively inexpensively
    + ship the key actors and the rest Italian (they say their lines in Italian)
    + later dubbed in English
    + did not play into the stereotypical American Western: here everyone is
      ugly
    + deliberately chosen: makers wanted to make it realistic, sense of irony
    + no clear demarkation between good and bad
- over 500 film credits

### The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966)

- use of sound effects, voices and electric guitars

#### Scene 1: Fairly Early in to the film

- we hear the electric guitar
- becomes very popular, 1st generation of rock and roll

### The Mission (1986)

- blend of catholic texts and musical styles with indigenous musical elements
  and instruments
- **wont be tested on this!**

## John Barry (1933 - 2011)

- classical pianist/trumpet
- turned to pop music in his 20s
- early 1960s is a well known British pop musician
- came in very last minute into the film called **Dr. No**

### Dr. No (1962)

- James Bond
- Monty Norman (original composer, but his music wasn't used)
- Barry composed the music for 11 James bond films
- awkward music phases because Barry came in very very late
- lawsuit
    + Monty had an iron clad contract so he owned all music written by Barry
    + how much is it worth? Monty made over 1 million from copy rights
- won 5 academy awards including **Born Free** (1967), **Out of Africa** (1986),
  **Dances With Wolves** (1991)
- style defined by clear, tonal melodies (pop influence)
- grand use of strings and brass
- remarkable distinctive style: pop influence, good sense of melody, hummable
    + You only Live Twice
    + Out of Africa

- in addition to the increasing impact of popular music, atonality and
  avant-garde styles are also becoming more prominent as the traditional
orchestral score is diminished in importance
- *modernism*: rejection of the past in favour of the new
- moving from 'realism' to 'abstract'
- modernism linked with WWI: devastation of the minds of those who lived through
  it
- it was the first modern war: tanks, guns, humans experienced murder on an
  industrial scale, for many it was the end of the world, capacity to destroy
was beyond our ability to control it
- extraordinary change on the mind set: came to conclusion that we cannot live
  based on old systems
- need new way of thinking: roots of modernism
- artists begin to explore new ways to represent the world: abstract arts
- music: shift towards atonality
