# Lecture 2

## Evaluating a score:
- **How do we talk about what we hear?**

## Key Terms and Concepts
- **Diegesis**
  - The world of narrative. All characters, events, etc depicted, suggested, or
    described.
  - Not just the stuff you see, but also the stuff you hear etc.
  - Example: Harry Potter - see all the 7 movies and you can see that they are
    consistent over all the movies. 

- **Diagetic Music**
  - music whose source is within the Diegesis
  - heard both by the characters within the narrative and the film audience.
  - Can take on any form - radio, band in the movie, radio in the car, playing
    guitar in the store etc and this all happens in the movie.
  - also known as "source music", "direct music" or "foreground music"
  - Functions include: establishing time and place, creating a sense of "realism
    and immediacy" offereing ironic comment.
  - Example: The 4th Indiana Jones movie uses the music from a different time to
    show that this movie is no longer based in the 20s.
  - It can also bring you closer to the film. Maybe the music is from the
    character's favorite musican etc and can give you another thing you can
    relate to with the movie.
  - Musical accompaniment - as an example someone getting murdered and there is
    actually music in the movie. You can do some creative scoring without
    actually using it as score and instead relying on source music.

 - **Nondiagetic Music**
  - heard only by the film audience
  - this is what we think of when we think of film music
  - also called "score", "underscore", or "background music"
  - if it is only created for the movie -> "original score"
  - normally originally composed for the specific film (original score)
  - usually there is very solid line separating the movie world from the score
  - May also include preexisting music "adapted" for the film.
    - Rarely you can just take the music and drop it on the movie. Rarely if
      ever both the movie and music will line up. You need to get a
      composer/arranger to actually get the two pieces to work together.
    - Example: **The Sting** (1973) Music of Scott Joplin, adapted by Marvin
      Hamlisch
      - Most people listenting to something like "The Entertainer" they think of
        the early 20th centuary.
      - This aligned with the movie since the movie was set in the early 20th
        centuary and the music of Scott Joplin gives you the sense of time.
      - The composer (Marvin Hamlisch) plays around with the music, and fits it
        into the film. If this is well done, people don't realize that anything
        has actually changed. Change it enough to adapt but not enough to loose
        what the piece actually was.
   - May also include preexisting music used without adaption. 
    - Director edits the movie/scene to match the music and not touch the music
      piece.
    - Example: **Platoon** (1986) Composer: George Deleure, also includes Samuel
      Barber's _Adagio for Strings_ (1938). Also used in **The Elephant Man**
      (1980) and **Sicko** (2007).
    - When you encounter music like this, the narrative gets suspended and the
      scene just becomes a visual spectical to behold. Dialogue tends to stop.
      You are basically taking in the moment and visual.
   - All preexisting music, "Compiled Score"
    - Example: **2001: A Space Odyssey** (1968) - Compiled from the works of R.
      Strauss, J Strauss etc. Some poeple thing it is very slow and long winded
      and where some people thought of it being the best marriage of music and
      cinema.
    - Topic of huge debate

## Describing the Music:
- *Style*
  - what type of music has the composer chosen?
  - what type of instruments?
  - how do these choices relate to the film as a whole?
  - Example: **Restoration** (1995) Composer: James Newton Howard
    - set in the mid 1600s
    - Score is part of original part adapted, based on the work of Henry
      Purcell, an importer composer of the period. Barque Era (1600s-1700s) of
      music and the big composers of the time include Bacque.
    - Use of period instruments including *Harpsichord*. This instrument is
      like the piano but instead of the hammer hitting the string, they are
      instead plucked.
    - Dominant instrumentations are string instruments like a violin etc.
    - No woodwind instruments or brass instruments b/c these instruments were
      much more rudimentary at the time (1600s).
    - Style of music that dominated this period - Terrace Dynamics -> In the
      Barque it was comman place to pick a loudness level and play at it and
      jump to whatever the next loundness level followed. This is unlike the
      music period that followed where the music could build up and drop off b/w
      different loudness levels.
    - The music of the Barque also works with how the characters behave where
      the way tou act is very stright and people keep their emotions underwrap
      but a whole lot of things are happening in the back (affairs etc).
  - Example: **Local Hero** (1983) Composer: Mark Knopfler
    - plot follows an urban American in a small Scottish Village
    - blend of folk and popular styles
    - emphasis on instruments such as the guitar
    - Knopfler developed melodies similar to Anglo Celtic folk music.
    - Musical choice works for the character study of the people in a small
      village. Low number of instruments used.
  - Example: **The Godfather** (1972) Composer: Nino Rota
    - Follows the life of an organized crime family
    - much of the instrumentation and melodies based on the folk music of
      Sicily
    - the music mirrors the state of mind of Don Corlionne
    - why is there a lone instrument b/c we see throughout the movie that even
      though Don Corlionne is around a whole lot off people but he is alone and
      cannot really trust anyone. The solo trumpet embodies the idea that he is
      alone and cannot turn to anyone.
    - what are we listening to? - Sicilian Wedding band. The movie opens with
      his daughter's wedding.
    - If he could give up all of this and go back to being a kid in Sicily he
      would take it. He has lost his innocence and soul.
    - The wedding band also gives the idea of importance of family.

## Concept
- is the music used in a consistent manner throughout the film?
- when is there music? When is it missing? When does the music start? 
- What is accompanied? What is left without accompaniment?
- What "motivates" the music? Action, characters, events, objects, flashbacks,
  etc...

### Conceptual Approaches
Most film music will fall somewhere between two extremes:

1. Playing the Drama
  - music attempts to reinforce primarily emotional elements within the
    narrative

2. Hitting the Action
  - music accents the visual elements
  - common approach to cartoon scoring
  - "Mickey Mousing" - hitting the action way too much
    - Danny Eltman does this often in the movie he composes
  - Historically you see this often in cartoons.

## Musical Characteristics

1. **Melody or Theme**
  - Considered the most "recognizable" music element for western ears.
  - Do characters, objects or situations have a particular melody associated
    with them?
  - The melody is the main music line the singer sings of the instruments plays
  - film composers take great advantage of musical themes of carrying a score
    through an entire film.
  - German Opera composer Richard Wagner - Leitmotive (the theme). In his theory
    you work out the melody and then it goes through changes to match the
    characters state.
  - Melodies can be taken through a number of variations to tell you what is
    going on within a particular character - thoughts or feelings etc...
  - Are the melodies easy to hum, or are they "angular" and more difficult?
    - The more "hummable" the melody/themes tend to be the more chances are it
      is probably accompanying the people/charatcers you are supposed to be
      rooting for.
    - The less "hummable" melody/themes tend to accompany the antagonist(s)
  - Example: **Star Wars** (1977) Composer: John Williams

2. **Tempo or Pulse**
  - How does the speed of music influence the "tempo" of the narrative?
  - On-screen action, framing, editing, sound design
  - Very important with pacing
  - usually music plays how we expect. Fight -> aggressive music etc
  - sometimes music plays against the action in the film and this is interesting to study
  - usually the main enemy of the music is dialogue
  - Example: **The Return of the King** (2004) Composer: Howard Shore
    - We start with source music -> hobbit is singing in the movie
    - We cut to the knights ridding but the music keeps playing and you see this song crosses the boundary b/w digetic and nondigetic music.
    - The quality of the voice changes -> starts with him in the room and gives us the feeling we are in the room and when the scene changes they sounds gets echo-y and sort of becomes supernatural realm
    - The action and sounds in the actual movie gets slow when the music is playing. You hear the sound of the bows being pulled back, the swords being unsheathed but you only see the characters yelling "Attack" but don't hear any sound.
    - You hear this note from the orchestra coming in and it fits in but then other odd notes come in and the tune gets very uncomfortable.
    - The moment the orc captain yells fire, all the sound just stops and the hobbit singing the last 2 notes of the song.
    - The scene plays against your expectation. You expect up beat battle music to play but instead you get a much slower music.

3. **Harmony**
  - Difficult to describe w/o musical training.
  - Chaotic or orderly? Consonant or dissonant (music tends to become less familiar) ? What do these suggest about events in the Diegesis?
  - Octave -> the division b/w notes. Octave is broken into 12 equal steps
  - Example: Highly Consonant: _Main Theme_ from *Cider House Rules* (1999) Composer: Rachael Portman
    - character driven film about a young man who grows up in a orphanage and brought up by a doctor and becomes a doctor. Coming of age, falling in love etc. Very gentle film.
  - Example: Blend of Consonant and Dissonant: _Yes_ from **Meet Joe Black** (1998) Composer: Thomas Newman
    - Death takes on human from and takes on human characteristics. Very very slow movie and beautifully shot.
    - This is where we see the character of death appearing for the first time.
    - Music is not scary but you can't predict what comes next. It doesn't stray too far so it doesn't become too unnerving. Sense of mystery b/c Newman does not stick to the major scale. You loose the sense of firm grounding you get in something like Cider House Rules theme.
  - Example: Dissonant _Bishop's Countdown_ from **Aliens** (1986) Composer: James Horner
    - utterly chaotic, utterly dissonant
    - just saved a little girl but realizes that she is trapped and is in the mercy of the alien. She is saved by a ship that she thought had left her.
    - Horner switches briefly back to the major scale when they realize that they are going to be saved.

## Technical Details: How It's Done:

### Basic Timetable of Film Production

1. Preproduction 
  - preparation phase
  - script writing and editing
  - financial backing
  - hiring of director, casting of actors
  - location scouting
  - various aspects of production design (costume designer & set design, etc) undertaken
  - storyboarding, Pre-visualization (pre-vis) -> look up Pre-vis for Prometheus
  - producers -> in charge of the business and organizational side of it

2. Production
  - finalization of script and production design
  - principle photography
  - actually shoot the film

3. Post Production
  - assembling and editing the "takes"
  - compilation and addition of visual and audio effects
  - composition and addition of music
  - normally, an original film score is one of the final elements to be created and added to the film
  - schedule for the composition and recording of a score: 5 to 8 weeks on average
