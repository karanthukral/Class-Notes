## Silent -> Talkies

- Music virtually disappears in talkies (narrative movies).
- By the 1930s, post-production has become better.
- You can record movie after the fact in post production but directors were
  worried that audience would be confused if there was a music in the movie.
- Motion picture making changed so much because of the rise of music.
- By early 1930s people started coming back to the idea that music could be a
  part of the narrative movies in sound movies and not only silent.

### Max Steiner

- **King Kong** (1933) - Composer: Max Steiner
  - in test screenings people were laughing
  - Worried that it would flop
  - Steiner asked to compile score but he convinced producer to compile original score.
  - Addition of music added oompf to the movie and it starts to becoming scary
  - Steiner uses themes (Thematic Developments)
  - Theme for King Kong is basically 3 notes
  - Brass, big strings, very simple, donates size and strength of King Kong
  - The simple yet powerful theme for King Kong related to the simplicity and power of Kong
  - No music at all for the first 20 min. 
  - Missing music gives us the sense of realism.
  - He brings in the music moment the ship gets into the fog. Idea when some mythical character is present, their layer is surrounded by a transition zone (smoke in this case).
  - You go into the fog, they leave the real world and enter the mythical world.
  - The beginning of music is a slow music, not scary, no danger yet.
  - Spacey/surreal music as they drift through the fog.
  - You start to hear the drums -> source music.
  - You hear the drums and at the same time you start to hear the brass instruments playing a simpler version of the Kong theme.
  - Unclear what the characters in the movie can here. There is a blurring between non-diegetic and diegetic (don't see this today). He is supposed to be hearing the drums but it's not clear.
  - This shows people were just starting to experiment with music.
  - Once they go on the island, they see a ceremony take place. The woman is the centre piece in the ceremony.
  - What can they actually hear? What instruments are being played in the movie vs the score?
  - Steiner hits the action (mickey mouses). A lot that Steiner does comes from his Broadway experience.
  - Mickey Mouses the shit out of it when the chief is walking down the steps.
  - The whole sequence is very similar to Broadway style.
  - The musical accompaniments are surreal and not real at all. You tend to see this in musicals.

- One of main points of Kong was the fact that the rules were being made up
- 1934 -> After king kong people started looking at music again. In 1934 Academy
  Awards gave out the first award for original score.

- **The Informer** (1935) - Composer: Max Steiner
  - Got Steiner his first academy award for "Best Original Score". Second
    Academy Award for original score given out.
  - Very dark movie
  - Set in Ireland in the early 1900. A time when Ireland is still occupied by
    the Britsh. Gurriela war is going on, the gurrilas were called the IRA. 
  - Follows Gippo Noarlan. Rejected from the IRA, has a very controlling GF.
    Makes a mistake and informs the location of his friend to the British for 20
    pounds.
  - Retelling the story of Judas who ratted out Jesus in the Old Testament.
  - In the end he is shot by the IRA. As he is dying he begs forgiveness from
    his friend's mom.
  - Two very clear themes - One for Gippo and one for Gippo's GF.
  - Mickey Mousing is still present. One of his defining characteristics.
  - Quoting themes (folk songs, popular songs) that people would know. Another
    one of his defining charactersistics.
  - The music is synced to Gippo's walking.
  - The quote when we looks at the poster -> what tune is it? -> Rule Britannia
    -> Would have been recognized by the audience immediately. Unofficial
    national anthem of Britin.
    - British -> Villain, IRA and Frankie -> Heroes
    - That is why Rule Britannia is played in a dissonant manner.
  - Almost like it's a musical. Presented like a ballet or dance of sorts.
  - Theme of the music:
    - Anglo-Celtic flavour
    - supposed to sound like folk music from Ireland and Scotland
    - The Scottish lillt is used -> extra note off the beat that pushes you
      forward. Used often in anglo-celtic movies.
    - Suggests folk music.
    - Frankie is characterized like this.
  - Katie (Gippo's GF)
    - Present like a lot of Christan saints or mother Mary.
    - Quote (10 pounds to America Poster) -> Yankee Doodle. American Folk song.
      Thematic Tranformation, taking a theme we know and playing in a slightly
      different manner. Seems off and this foreshadows that this will lead to
      something bad that happens in the film.
    - The entire scene is choreographed and mickey mousing. Similar to Broadway.
    - Theme:
      - Very Jazzy
      - Sound based in jazz played by an orchestra
      - At the time jazz is a music that was associated with the underbelly and
        crime, illegal activities (drinking after hours, prostetution).
      - Portrared like the urban world but also associated with the underworld
        which comes from the jazz.
      - Constrasting with Gippo's theme -> Gippo is the innocent, dumb one and
        Katie is the urban, smart but also the bad one (jazz).

- Other notable films: **Gone With The Wind** (1939); **Casablanca** (1942); **A
  Summer Place** (1959)
- Most of his career - head of music at Warner Bros (1937-1953)
- Most of his important work is during the 1930 to the early 1950s.
- Workaholic - contributed to over 300 film scores during his career (Died in
  1971). Didn't write all the music. Delegated some work to others.

---

- 1930s: sound film develops many of the conventions that will define it.
- Begins as an extension of the silent film but by the end of the decade,
  technical advances and aesthetic changes have developed into its own medium.

### The "Émigré" Composer

- Nazis force out many of Europe's artists and intellectuals.
- Erich Korngold, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman, Ernst Gold, Hans Salter,
  Bronislau Kaper, Miklos Rosza.
- Most were composers trained in traditions of European art music and these
  traditions (Operatic) were transplanted into Hollywood during the 1930s.
    - Dominated by Warner styles
    - Operatic styles
    - 19th century
- They write what they know. They write in the style of Wagner and this the time
  when this style takes over Hollywood.
- Alfred Newman and Herbert Stothart are two of the few American born composers
  of the period.
  - Stothart -> popular for composing music for Wizard of Oz. Didn't write the
  music which was written by pop musicians.
  - If Hollywood had a royal family the Newman's would be the one. Alfred Newman
    has 2 sons -> Thomas Newman (Composer for Wall:E).
  - Alfred Newman wrote the 20th century fox intro

### Erich Wolfgang Korngold: (1897-1957)

- Born after Steiner (10 years younger). Like Steiner born in Vienna which was
  the centre of European music.
- His dad was a music critique and very popular.
- childhood prodigy, son of noted music critic.
- teachers included Strauss and Mahler.
- Considered to be the 2nd best composer in all of Europe.
- 1934, Mendelssohn's "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
  - Oversaw the music for the stage production
  - Has a lot of songs in it
  - The original music did not survive so we have no clue what it sounds like
  - One of the challenges for a composer is to write new music for the songs in
    the play.
  - Hollywood still looking for things they can make movies out of.
  - Word came that Hollywood was looking to make this into a movie
  - He gets asked to come to Hollywood to oversee the music for this movie
- Liked Hollywood, returned several time over the next few years to do scores.
  - He finds a world where you can write something and have it in a movie in a
    week. This turnaround was very different for someone who grew up with
    classical music where some composers never heard their work played in their
    life time.
- One of the few musicians of the studio era where he could freelance when other
  could not.
- Academy Award for **Anthony Adverse** (1936).
- In 1938 Korngold asked to do **Robin Hood** but refused.
- All the scores up till now that he had done were character driven. Robin Hood
  had too much Squash buckling, big and exciting.
- Austria annexed by the Nazis and all of his family's wealth and property was
  seized. Korngold was Jewish -> He had nothing except the money in his pocket.
- With the money he got from Robin Hood, he moves his family from Austria to
  Cali.
- Academy Award for **Robin Hood** - first time award was given directly to the
  composer, not head of music department.
- remained in Hollywood, died in 1957, disappointed that he was never able to
  regain his position as a "serious composer".
- Freelanced, composed only 19 film score in 12 years.
