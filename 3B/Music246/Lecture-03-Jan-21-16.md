## Composer's involvement
- Composer's involvement varies based on working style and specifics of a given project

**Hiring**
- freelance or studio contract
- collaborate partnership (Spielberg/Williams; Nolan/Zimmer)

**Scripts**
- can give composers a "head start"
- research for "ethnic" or "historical" influences
- gives them time to research to match the score to time and cultural themes in the script
- production of important source music is done this point
- in general, composing the score cannot be done in the basis of a script - why?
- scrips can change significantly
- only words, no clear timing or pace for the composer to work with
- can help with composing source music
- not the best place to start cause it doesn't tell you the timing of the dialogues/scenes etc. The timings is the single most important technical detail that the composer needs to know before composing.

**Screening**
- several different opportunities to see the film
- rushes: film shot that day, will go through that and try and decide which scenes worked, which shots worked etc. If there is a shot missing they need to reschedule. Good to get a sense of what the scene would look like but rushes aren't great since its all unedited film
- assembly cut: significantly longer than finished film. Gives a better idea than rushes but still doesn't tell you what the movie would look like.
- rough cut: closer to finished film, but still undergoing significant editing. Composer can't start working seriously yet cause they haven't finalized how long the scenes stay, how and when camera cuts and so on
- fine or locked cut: most if not all editing completed. Magic word for a composer cause they can finally start working on this
- Most composer begin serious work at the fine cut phase - why?
- concern that repeated viewings will alter the composer's reaction. Some composer's don't come in until the final cut cause they often rely on their gut and they don't want to watch the movie so much that they start second guessing. This also helps them be in the shoes of the movie goer of watching the movie for the first time
- timings of scenes

**Temp Tracks**
- "temporary" music added to film while still in prod or early editing
- gives more "finished" feeling to work in progress
- often taken from other film scores, or "classical" music
- cannot use this in the actual film cause the rights are owned by other people and can be very expensive to get the rights. Also not made for the movie/scene so might not get the exact reaction one needs/wants
- some directors can too used to the temp track that they are not willing to hear to the ideas of the composer and gets them stuck on the familiar
- Composers are deeply divided on their view of temp tracks - why?
  - offer insight into director's thinking process
  - BUT can influence the composer's initial response
  - director's familiarity with temp track can be an obstacle
  - listening to some one else's music can influence initial thoughts

**Spotting Session and Cue Sheets**
- director, composer, music editor/music supervisor
- talk about where the music should be and what they want the music to do
- discussion on placement of "cues"
- timings, approach, etc
- music editor then prepares "Spotting notes" or cue sheet

**Composing**
- 5 to 8 weeks until "delivery" of finished score
- "You will never stop working on a score, you will stop working on it"
- frequently exacerbated by production phase running overtime
- **Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves** (1991)
  - Composer: Michael Kamen; 2 hours, 11 min of music/produced in 3.5 weeks
- _Orchestrators_ - skilled in composition, music theory, and knowledge of the orchestra
  - Before the 1980s you could not work as a film composer unless you could write music notes
  - This person's job is to figure out what each instrument is doing and produce something that is more organized and musician friendly compared to the first draft done by the composer
- synth demonstrations
  - give the director a good idea about how the music will sound when real musicians play it
- copyist produce final parts for musicians. They separate the parts for each musician and give them the correct parts. They also have a good idea of what can be played and what can't.
- music librarians organize parts for recording sessions
- conductors and studio musicians (good sight readers)
  - **Sight Reading** - you can sit down with sheet music and play it right the first time
  - some composers do their own conducting and some don't.
  - Film music conducting requires a very specific skill set. Most conductors conduct while watching the movie to sync it with the movie
- recording sessions
- **synchronization**: punch and streamers / click tracks / SMPTE
  - **puch and streamers** - as you composed your score, you would take note of the particular cues in the movie that you really wanted the music to sync to. Then the film editor would mark the film at those cues and the conductor could see this as they were conducting.
  - **click track** - basically a metronome
- mixing

## The Silent Era: (1895-1927)

### The Persistence of Vision

Film is discontinuous on a very low level, you are presented with continuous motion, instead they are series of still images in succession. Your brain starts to fill in the gaps and you get the illusion of continuous motion.

**Early Development:**
- **The Zoopraxiscope** (1879) - project several images to present the illusion of motion

**Thomas Edison:**
- **The Kinetoscope** (1891) - Peephole viewer with a continuous loop of film
- **The Kinetophone** (1895) - A kinetoscope with a phonograph installed in the box
  - Both devices used electric motors to run and its very hard to get them to sync properly. Out of sync breaks the illusion
- Problem with synchronizing movie + sound

### First Projected Film

- _The Lumiere Brothers_, Paris December 28th, 1895. "**The Arrival of a Train**"
- Way to demonstrate technology
- Very short films of about 20-30 sec
- They hired a piano player who played along with the first showing

### Reasons for musical accomplishment

1. **Pragmatic**: mechanical noise / mechanic problems
  - projector was a branch new piece of high technology and it could break down very easily. What happens if it breaks down? Piano player can entertain people when technology fails. 
  - projectors are noisy beasts. Music makes the environment friendlier by covering up the sound of loud technology

2. **Psychoanalytic**: Audience disturbed by ghost like images
  - make the characters on film more human and more realistic

3. **Continuity** of Tradition: Long history of musical accompaniment for visual presentation
  - music + theatrical presentation goes back to the ancient Greece.
  - the first few years were not seen as a theatrical piece. They were basically seen as technical marvel

### Venues

- Vaudeville Theatres - style of wide variety show. Troop of performers who would travel and perform. Actors, jugglers, singers, animals, skits etc.
- They started playing movies in the breaks (interval)
- Vaudeville was basically killed by the popularity of movies
- Musical accompaniment provided by vaudeville orchestra

- 1905 "**Nickelodeons**"
  - come up any where
  - buildings, factories etc
  - would charge you a nickel to come see movies
  - 1907 - 3000; 1910 - Over 10,000
  - Accompaniment provided by:
    - gramophone, solo piano, piano with singer, small orchestra (less than 10 musicians)
    - Popular to classic - often little relationship to the film
    - Improvisation to the film
    - "Illustrated Songs" - first music videos
    - Without music, but with sound effects, live dialogue or narration.
    - continuous music provided mechanically (Phonograph or Player Piano) - Ballyhoo music

### The Shift To Narrative

**George Melies:**
- early experimenter with camera effects
- _A Trip to the Moon_ (1902)
- Not the first narrative, but over ten minutes in length, multiple scenes, sets, costumes etc - early model for narrative film to come\
- hand painted each frame to make colour film

**Edwin Porter**
- _The Great Train Robbery_ (1903)
- First narrative film to use discontinuous action - cross cutting

**1905-1910**
- Narrative films become most important element - films become longer - plots become more complex
- Change in musical aesthetic from entertaining the audience to "playing the picture". Supporting the drama and helping the audience to follow the plot. "Fitting" or "Synchronizing"
  - First real acknowledgement that music is actually supporting what's going on the screen as the narrative
- "Song Title Accompaniment"
  - the practice where you would link just the song title to what was going on the screen. 
  - Example: soldier dying and the music being played is like "I'll see you on the other side"
- Classical music and limited improvisation

**1910-1920s**
- film industry matures
- Films become longer, more sophisticated
- First of the "Movie Palaces" built, 1912 - Theatres
  - All these movie theatres were built with areas for orchestras
