# Dimitri Tiomkin (1894-1979)

- Born in Russia
- Played piano in Russian silent movie theaters
- 1925 - USA: worked in vaudeville
- Began work in Hollywood during the 1930s
- Father was a musician and got into the film industry fairly early unlike people
  like Korngold
- Important films include: **Lost Horizon** (1937); **It's a Wonderful Life** (1946)
- **Lost Horizon** - One of the biggest escapist films

## High Moon (1952)

- Score based on a popular song composed by Tiomkin
- **"Do Not Forsake Me"**
- Song was going to be written for the film
- Western/Country music
- Hit for singer **Tex Ritter**
- Song was "pre released" and established the use of "Movie Songs"
- Released around the same time (movie and song) in order to use them for cross
  promotion
- Received AA (Academy Award) for the best score and best song
- Notable for the high level of integration of the song melody within the score

### Scene 1: Opening Credits

- The pop song plays - familiar now but this was the first film to do it in a
  concrete way

### Scene 2: Train Arrives

- Sheriff writing his will
- Montage of scenes playing along with a tik-tok of a clock
- Tiomkin convinces the director to create the montage scenes either 2 sec or 4
  sec which allows Tiomkin can write the music which can run uninterested.
- Melodic material is taken from the opening song
- Tiomkin took parts of the song from the opening song and assigns them to
  individual characters
- Music builds until the end where the chair is in frame and then suddenly ends
  with the train coming into town

# Bernard Herrmann (1911-1975)

- Born in NYC
- Studied at Julliard
- man was universally disliked
- worked at CBS Radio in 1934
- prior to tv, radio is not like radio we know today. It's the tv of the time
  which shows, kids shows and so on
- Starts to work with **Orson Wells**
- Wells had a radio theater company called **Mercury Plays/Theater**
- Wells planned a radio show for **War of the Worlds**
  - It started of a fake radio show
  - People who tuned in the middle of the show, people freaked the fuck out
  - People died caused people started shooting thinking the Martians were
    invading
- Travels with Wells to Hollywood in 1940

## Citizen Kane (1941)

- Sick movie. One of the reasons it worked out so well was because Wells didn't
  know what the fuck he was doing

## The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)

- Herrmann gets an idea
- "What is an Orchestra?"
- Orchestra - Standardized performance ensemble
  - every major city has one
  - they are all the same
  - if you write orchestra piece, it can be played anywhere
- Herrmann realizes that he is writing film music that does not need to played
  by an orchestra - he doesn't need to write it for a standardized metric
- He just needs the music to be played one - the day of the recording
- He has the option of not only creating the music but also a unique character
  by creating a unique ensemble
- unique set of instruments: violin, cello, and bass (all three electric), two
  theremins, three electric organs, three vibraphones, two glockenspiels (bell
  like instruments), two pianos, two harps, three trumpets, three trombones, and
  four tubas.
- Herrmann's approach: the sound of a score depends on the instrumentation
- Only required for recording session - no need to focus on performance
  ensemble

### Scene 1: Aliens emerge for the first time

- Finally some new shit here
- Herrmann just gives us "Notes Clouds" - collection of notes. Not a lot of
  movement, no real melody
- Sense of wonder, fantastic and underlying sense of tension
- Distinct sound
- Suspended set of notes
- Music shots right at the gun shot - he doesn't build up to it though
- Trance from the music, gunshot snaps back to reality

### Scene 2: Meet Gort - Giant Fucking Robot

- Music completely changes from Scene 1
- very powerful wall of tubas
- one note after another, relentless
- doesn't use any widely used scale but the rhythm is relentless personifying the robot
  - it will destroy the earth slowly but relentlessly if stuff doesn't work out
- note choices do not fall into any sense of expectation of the audience


- 1955 begins collaboration with **Alfred Hitchcock**
- Hitchcock is referred to as an auteur - Label given to a director who has such
  a remarkable approach, big vision for their films that it stretches across
  their entire body of work
  - Hitchcock - Interested in the response of ordinary people to extraordinary
    events
  - Interested in the idea of watching people when the people don't think they
    are being watched

- **Vertigo** (1958), **North By Northwest** (1959) 

## North By Northwest (1959)

### Scene 1: Kary Grant gets off in the middle of nowhere

- Little over half way through the film
- good use of where the music is absent
- Hitchcock wanted music but Herrmann said that it would be better not to have
  any
- Without any music, audience is in the same mind set as Kary Grant. No fucking
  clue what's happening
- sense of uncertainty

## Psycho (1960)

- Limited budget - shot in black and white
  - Despite being a hot shot even Hitchcock had trouble getting money for this
    film
  - edgy and unnerving film
- Herrmann uses only strings "black and white" score
- Strings can create great amount of sounds
- Uses the variety of sounds that can be produced by string section
- Cues tend to set a single mood and show little response to what happens minute
  by minute
- Overall the mood is bleak and has little emotional warmth
- Cold mood and just goes with it - phrasing the drama
