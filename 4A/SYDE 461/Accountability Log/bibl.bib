  abstract =	 {We address the problem of learning a detector of malicious behavior in network
	traffic. The malicious behavior is detected based on the analysis of network
	proxy logs that capture malware communication between client and server
	computers. The conceptual problem in using the standard supervised learning
	methods is the lack of sufficiently representative training set containing
	examples of malicious and legitimate communication. Annotation of individual
	proxy logs is an expensive process involving security experts and does not
	scale with constantly evolving malware. However, weak supervision can be
	achieved on the level of properly defined bags of proxy logs by leveraging
	internet domain black lists, security reports, and sandboxing analysis. We
	demonstrate that an accurate detector can be obtained from the collected
	security intelligence data by using a Multiple Instance Learning algorithm
	tailored to the Neyman-Pearson problem. We provide a thorough experimental
	evaluation on a large corpus of network communications collected from various
	company network environments.},
