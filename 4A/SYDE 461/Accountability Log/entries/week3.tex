\section{Back Propagation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reverse mode differentiation
	\item Regular chain rule gives you the derviative of the output with respect to one input/node
	\item Doing that for all nodes is intractable
	\item To extend this to find $\frac{\partial output}{\partial}$ with respect to all nodes and inputs in the neural net/graph you start using the chain rule from the other end (output) and go till the input layer. This is essential for neural networks. \cite{backprop}
\end{itemize}

\section{Multiple Instance Learning Paper}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Read paper on multiple instance learning and weak labelling to detetct security attacks \ref{franc:ecml1}

\section{Project Proposal}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Worked on reseraching background and prior art
	\item Researched prior art papers on using ML based suspicious urls \ref{suspicious-urls}, spam detection \ref{spam}, phishing detection \ref{phishing}, http request clustering \ref{http-cluster} and botnet detection \ref{botnet}.
	\item Researched recent hacks and security attacks like Pipa Middleton \ref{icloud-hack}, OVH ddos, Yahoo hack \ref{yahoo-hack}.
\end{itemize}
